# About the Project
This library (mainly header files) resulted from needs I commonly had (and will have) with my C++ projects. The library will contain a growing set of functions for often needed tasks like file operations, streams to add transparent compression/decompression layers, etc.

Currently, the library is a dependency of my project **KSynth** (https://github.com/k-a-z-u/KSynth), provides file-system options and streaming IO.
